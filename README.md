# Piranoid
Piranoid is an operating system for Raspberry-pi that assumes that its operator is under assault from the government, and it does everything it can to keep your communications and documents a secret.

Concept from [Little Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_(Doctorow_novel)) by [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow), Re-designed for Raspberry-pi.

*Coming Soon!*
